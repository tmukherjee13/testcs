-----

Once the extension is installed, Add the following in console.php:

```php
return [
    ...
    'components' => [
        ...
    ],
    'controllerMap' => [
        'migration' => [
            'class' => 'tmukherjee13\migration\console\controllers\MigrationController',
            'templateFile' => '@tmukherjee13/migration/views/template.php',
